1) What are the weights of the three steering behaviors in your flocking model?

public int separationWeight = 3;
public int alignmentWeight = 2;
public int cohesionWeight = 1;


2) In Part 2, what did you do for avoiding a group of agents? 
	What are the weights of path following and evade behavior? 
	Did you use a separation algorithm, and what were its parameters?
